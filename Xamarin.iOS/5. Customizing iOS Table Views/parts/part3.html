        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>The primary goal of this lab will be to create a settings page for our weather app by designing custom static cells with the Xamarin Storyboard Designer. <!-- Include a screen shot of the completed project? -->

        <!-- Include any differences about the OS or environment expectations
             if there are changes from StartHere for this lab -->

        <!-- Note any starter/complete or assets included in this lab. -->
        <!-- Remove this section if there are none -->
        </p>
        <p><img src="res/images/finished.png"></p>
        <h2>Required assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Part 03 Resources</strong> contains a <b>begin</b> project and a completed solution that you can use to check your work.
            Please make sure you have this folder before you begin.            </p>

        <!-- Give them a challenge here, high-level steps of what we want them to do
             so they can use this instead of the step-by-step (baby steps) included below -->
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Here are the high-level steps you will need to perform. Use these to complete the exercise and refer to the more detailed step-by-step instructions to fill in any necessary details. In this exercise you will  recreate the first five cells of the Settings App for the iPhone to get a feel for how you would create static cells in Storyboard Designer.</p>
        <p>
            Our basic steps will be:
      <ol>
              <!-- Can put additional hints in collapsable blocks for additional resources - these should be
   things we covered in the materials already, but useful as reminders for how to complete a task. Make sure to replace the "unique_id_here", also you have to write out the starting text twice - make sure they are the same! -->

              <li>Open the <strong>Begin</strong> solution provided in the Part 03 Resources folder.</li>
              <!-- Can put additional hints in collapsable blocks for additional resources - these should be
   things we covered in the materials already, but useful as reminders for how to complete a task. Make sure to replace the "unique_id_here", also you have to write out the starting text twice - make sure they are the same! -->
              <li>Working in the <strong>MainStoryboard.storyboard</strong> file, select the table view.</li>
              <li>Change the<strong> table view</strong> to display <strong>one section of static cells</strong> with a dark gray cell separator.</li>
              <li>Change the <strong>section header </strong> to read &quot;Settings&quot; and create 5 rows of cells.</li>
              <li>Add the missing cells to the UItableView from the Widget tab of the properties pane.</li>
              <li>For each cell add, style and position the following UIImageViews,
                UILabels and UIControllers from the toolbox to each of the cells:</li>

      <p><img src="res/images/UIViews.png" width="446" height="474"></p>
    <li>Replace the image and title placeholders with final content</ol>
        <!-- Steps -->
      <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspect the starter solution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>Begin</strong> solution provided in the Part 03 Resources folder.</li>
            <!-- Can put additional hints in collapsable blocks for additional resources - these should be
   things we covered in the materials already, but useful as reminders for how to complete a task. Make sure to replace the "unique_id_here", also you have to write out the starting text twice - make sure they are the same! -->
            <li>Open  the <strong>MainStoryboard.storyboard</strong> file and select the <strong>table view </strong>(not the controller).<br>
          </li>
            <li><code>UITableViews</code> come with dynamic protype cells by default, to change this you need to select the<strong> table view</strong> and change the content type in the properties pane to display one section of  static cells with a dark gray cell separator.</li></ol>
        <img src="res/images/staticCells.png">

      <ol start="4">
<li>Next, we will change some of the section properties. To do that we must first select the section on the storyboard and then change the properties of the<strong> table view section</strong> in the properties pane and <strong>change the header</strong> to &quot;Settings&quot; and <strong>number of rows</strong> to &quot;5&quot;</li></ol>
      <img src="res/images/sectionRowsHeader.png" width="653" height="227">
      <ol start="5">
            <li>For each cell we are going to add UILabels, UIImageViews and controls. </li> </ol>
      <ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The first three cells can be styled with the default cell styles.</li></ul></ul>
      <img src="res/images/staticCells.png" width="616" height="279" alt=""/>
      <ul><ul>
        <li>The bottom two cells are custom and we need to add the child UIViews to these cells:
          <ul>
          <li>First, select the cell.</li>
          <li>Drag and position the UI element from the toolbox onto the cell.</li>
          <li>To layout the elements more precisely you can select the element and specify the x and y coordinates in the layout tab of the properties pane.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
            </li>

     <img src="res/images/toolbox.png">
      <ol start="6">
        <li>An accessory is optional in a custom cell. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>We can add them by selecting the cell and then, in the widget tab of the properties pane, select the accessory you would like to use. </li>
        </ul></ol>
        <img src="res/images/disclosure.png">

      <ol start="7">
        <li>Now that the UI elements are placed we will customize them by providing new images and custom titles.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>To change the image select the UIImageView and select the icon you want to use from the image dropdown in the properties pane
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
           <img src="res/images/image.png">
           <ul>
             <ul>
               <li>To change the title and color of the UI label, select the label and change change them in the properties pane.</li>
             </ul>
           </ul>
        <img src="res/images/label.png">

           <ol start="8">
             <li>Once all of your images and label titles are changed your UITableView
                should look something like this:</li></ol>
             <img src="res/images/finished.png">
             <ol start="9"> <li>In order to interact with our cells in the code behind we need to set unique identifiers for each cell. 
                 For the custom cells we also name the child controls.</li>

             </ol>
