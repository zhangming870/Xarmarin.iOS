        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>15 minutes</p>

        <div class="hintblock">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If you are doing this exercise live in a session, make sure to make good use of the instructor, they are online to answer any questions you have!

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>
        During this lab we will update our Fireworks application, using constraints to size and position our views relative to the view controller. </p>

        <!-- Include a screen shot of the completed project? -->

        <!-- Include any differences about the OS or environment expectations
             if there are changes from StartHere for this lab -->

        <!-- Note any starter/complete or assets included in this lab. -->
        <!-- Remove this section if there are none -->
        <h2>Required assets</h2>
        <p>This lab is a continuation of the previous exercise.  You may use your project from exercise 01 or open the completed project in the <b>Part 01 Resources</b> folder.  
        There is a completed version of the exercise in the <strong>Part 02 Resources</strong> folder if you'd like to compare your solution when you are finished.
        </p>

        <!-- Give them a challenge here, high-level steps of what we want them to do
             so they can use this instead of the step-by-step (baby steps) included below -->
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Add constraints to the controls added in the previous exercise to allow them to dynamically size and position themselves relative to the parent view controller</p>
          <ol>
<!-- Can put additional hints in collapsible blocks for additional resources - these should be
   things we covered in the materials already, but useful as reminders for how to complete a task. Make sure to replace the "unique_id_here", also you have to write out the starting text twice - make sure they are the same! -->
                <li>Open completed solution from the previous exercise</li>
                <li>Open Main.storyboard</li>
                <li>Using the toolbar, add recommended constraints to both labels and the switch</li>
                <li>Use the constraint dragging controls to add constraints to the button</li>
                <li>Use the constraint dragging controls to add constraints to the slider</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Apply recommended constraints</h2>
        <p>For several of the controls, we can use the designer's automatic constraints feature.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Main.storyboard.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Night</b> label.</li>
            <li>Press the <b>Add recommended constraints</b> toolbar button (green plus).</li>
            <img src="res/images/constraints_toolbar.png" lt=""/>
            <li>Add recommended constraints to the second label and the switch (do not add constraints yet for the button or the slider).</li>
            <li>Run the application and try rotating the simulator or device to landscape ( Hardware &gt; Rotate Left).</li>
            <img src="res/images/lab2-rotate.png" width="542" height="248" style='border:1px solid #bbbbbb' lt="" img/>
          </ol>
        </h2>
        
   
        
        <h2>Add constraints to the button</h2>
        <p>We want the button to stretch and take up any available space.  
            The recommended constraints button adds fixed value constraints for width and height so we'll add constraints to the button by hand.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the button in the designer.</li>
            <li>Single click to show the constraints dragging controls.</li>
            <li>Use the right-edge constraint dragging bar and add a constraint to the right edge of the view controller.</li>
            <img src="res/images/constraint_dragging_btn.png" lt=""/>
            <li>Use the left-edge constraint dragging bar to add a constraint to the left edge of the switch.</li>
            <li>Use the center constraint dragging bar to add a vertical centering constraint to the switch.</li>
            <li>Run the application and try rotating the simulator or device to landscape.</li>
            <img src="res/images/ex2_btn_constraints.png" width="480" lt="" img style='border:1px solid #bbbbbb'/>
        </ol>

     <h2></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add constraints to the slider</li>
            <p>This will be very similar to adding constraints to the button.</p>
             <li>Use the right-edge constraint dragging bar and add a constraint to the right edge of the view controller.</li>
            <li>Use the left-edge constraint dragging bar to add a constraint to the left edge of the <b>Size</b> label.</li>
            <li>Use the center constraint dragging bar to add a vertical centering constraint to the <b>Size</b>> label.</li>
            <li>Run the application and try rotating the simulator or device to landscape.</li>
            <img src="res/images/ex2_complete.png" width="480" lt="" img style='border:1px solid #bbbbbb'/>
        </ol>


    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>In this lab you added constraints to your views to allow them to dynamically size and position themselves on screen.</p>
